These stickers have been successfully manufactured at Gillespie Graphics in Wilsonville, Oregon.

They die cut them out of a material "MM-200-S" using an I-Cut machine, which does optical alignment to
the printed pattern to ensure good registration between the cut and the pattern.  This is critical
to obtaining a consistent signal over 360 degrees as the sticker rotates over the WW-1x encoder board.
