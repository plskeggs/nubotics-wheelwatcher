Sorry.

We never designed a board for a WW-11 test fixture; we made one using a bare WW-11 board,
by drilling holes for pogo pins that line up with the 5 pins of J1, with TP1-DEBUGWIRE,
and with U1 pin 3 (which connects to U3 pin 2, PB3).

It would be easy enough to copy the schematic for the WW-12 test fixture, and the layout
for the WW-11 board, and create a WW-11 test fixture.
