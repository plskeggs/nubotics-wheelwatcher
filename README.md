# nubotics-wheelwatcher
Welcome to the open hardware and firmware repository for the Nubotics WheelWatcher encoders, 
models WW-11 (for standard size servos) and WW-12 (for specific gearhead motors).

We started designing and manufacturing the original WheelWatcher encoders in 2004.
Much has changed in the hobby robotics field in the last 12 years.  Rather than
letting these designs disappear into the ether, we are opening them up so that
others may carry the torch and either build them for themselves or manufacturer
and sell them to others.  We only ask that you read, understand, and respect
the licenses we have applied.
